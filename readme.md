This project uses MongoDB to manage the databases. MongoDB collections are located in the project's `mongo` folder.

## Setting

To connect to MongoDB, make sure MongoDB is running on your system and the connection URL is set correctly in `server.js`.

### MongoDB Collections

The collections used in this project can be found in the `mongo` folder and are essential for the proper functioning of the implemented functionalities.

## Dependencies

This project uses several key dependencies to function correctly:

- **Express**: Server framework to handle HTTP requests.
- **Cors**: Used to allow or restrict requested resources on a web server depending on where the request comes from.
- **MongoDB**: Database to store data from the mentioned collections.
- **Bootstrap**: Facilitates rapid development with a CSS framework for responsive design.

Make sure you install all dependencies by running `npm install` inside the project directory.

## Rapid Development

For faster development, this project uses Bootstrap, I'm not trying to use it, it's just as a demonstration of what the elements should look like.
